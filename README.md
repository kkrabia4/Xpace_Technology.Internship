#### Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning pipeline for detecting credit card fraud using logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting classifiers. The dataset used is the `creditcard.csv` file.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn

You can install these using pip:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imbalanced-learn
### Dataset
The dataset creditcard.csv contains credit card transactions over a period of time, with a label column Class indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).
### Project Structure
creditcard.csv: The dataset file containing transaction records.
fraud_detection.ipynb: The Python script containing the code for the fraud detection pipeline.
### Conclusion
This project demonstrates a simple yet effective approach to detecting credit card fraud using machine learning. The use of SMOTE helps in handling class imbalance, and the performance of multiple classifiers is compared using classification reports.
